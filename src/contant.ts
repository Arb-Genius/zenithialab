        p1: "In angular contact ball bearings, the forces are transmitted from one raceway to the other at a specific contact angle (oblique to the radial plane). The bearings are therefore suitable for radial and axial loads acting simultaneously",

Due to their very low frictional torque, open bearings are suitable for high and very high speeds. Bearing designs with gap seals are suitable for high speeds.",

        p2: "Four point contact bearings are similar in their structure to double row angular contact ball bearings, but are considerably narrower in an axial direction due to only one raceway groove. Since the centres of curvature of the arc-shaped raceways on the inner ring and outer ring are offset relative to each other, the balls are in contact with the bearing rings at four points under radial load. For this reason, four point contact bearings are only used under predominantly axial load.",

The cage combines the two rows of balls and the inner ring to form a unit that can align itself by swivelling relative to the outer ring.",
        p2:"Due to the curved raceway on the outer ring, self-aligning ball bearings are tolerant of misalignment between the shaft and housing and deflections of the shaft. They can thus compensate static and dynamic angular defects within certain angular limits in a rotating shaft system.",
